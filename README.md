# simple-pancake
A simple project to use on front-end interviews.

## Goal

We would like to see a front end page that displays a todos.
The data of the table should be loaded from the API

#### AC
- Show two seperated tables for todos.
- Use pre-styled `frontend/src/app/components/todo-list` 
- Load the data from the todo API. API address is https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos
- Show completed and incomplete todos on two different tables
- Sort todos by title
- Implement a loading state so that the user can see a loading message while the data is loading
