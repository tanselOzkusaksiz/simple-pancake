# simple-pancake
A simple project to use on front-end interviews.

## Goal

We would like to see a front end page that displays two todo tables.
The data of the table should be loaded from the API

#### AC
- Fork the repo
- Load the data from the sample todo API. The API address is https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos
- Show two separated tables for todos: Show completed and incomplete todos on two different tables.
- Use pre-styled `frontend/src/app/components/todo-list` component
- Sort todos by title
- Optionally, implement a loading state so that the user can see a loading message while the data is loading
- Commit your changes
